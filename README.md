## Philosophy

The user must be able to input task information with **minimal effort and time**. The algorithm is then responsible for calculating the best task to be performed next so that **throughput** is maximized.

## The Platform
Originally, I developed this platform for personal use. Many of my friends have since requested access. This platform is now open to public and eternally free-for-use.

I'm too lazy to implement a sign-up page. Please open an issue so that I can get you an account.

Of course, you can always just clone this repo and self-host.
