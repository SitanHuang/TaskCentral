## Philosophy

TaskCentral is an opinionated TODO-style platform aiming to **reduce cognitive load** by displaying only relevant tasks at a given moment. Inspired by operating system kernel algorithms, it recommends users what to work on next to **guarantee maximum throughput**.

Users input **priority** (task importance), **weight** (work volume), and an earliest possible start date. Instead of an overwhelming list, you receive a concise daily task selection.

You can use it as a simple list if you'd like. But it can scale to your workflow: **stress forecast, Pomodoro timers, time tracking, productivity graphs**, etc.

The platform is eternally free.

## The Platform
Originally, I developed this platform for personal use. The platform is open to public and eternally free-for-use. Because I am hosting this with personal funds, I use Google Forms to prevent too many accounts overloading the server.
